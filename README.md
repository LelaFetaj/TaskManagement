# Task Management

Task Management System is a versatile web application designed to help individuals and teams efficiently organize and track their tasks. You will build this application using .NET Core 6 Web API, ensuring high performance and scalability. The system will incorporate JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure user authentication and authorization. It will follow the principles of Domain-Driven Design (DDD) to achieve a clean and maintainable architecture. Entity Framework will be utilized for seamless data management, allowing users to effectively manage their tasks.

Key Features:

User Registration and Authentication: Develop user registration and authentication endpoints using JWT. Users should be able to create an account, securely log in, and obtain a JWT token for subsequent API calls.

JWT Token-based Authorization: Implement token-based authorization, requiring a valid JWT token in the Authorization header for accessing protected endpoints. Ensure proper validation of tokens to grant authorized access.

Task Management: Enable users to create, update, and delete tasks. Implement features such as assigning tasks to specific users, setting due dates, adding task descriptions, and tracking task completion status.

Task Organization: Provide functionality for organizing tasks into projects, categories, or tags. Users should be able to filter and search for tasks based on these criteria, enhancing productivity and task management.

Collaboration and Team Management: Implement features for sharing tasks and collaborating with team members. Users should be able to assign tasks to specific team members, track task progress, and receive notifications on task updates.

Reminders and Notifications: Develop a notification system to remind users of upcoming task deadlines or important updates. Notifications can be sent through email, push notifications, or in-app notifications.

Priority and Urgency: Enable users to set task priorities and urgency levels. Implement sorting and filtering options based on these parameters, allowing users to focus on critical tasks.

Exception Handling: Implement robust exception-handling mechanisms to capture and handle errors gracefully. Provide detailed error messages and appropriate HTTP status codes, ensuring a smooth user experience.
